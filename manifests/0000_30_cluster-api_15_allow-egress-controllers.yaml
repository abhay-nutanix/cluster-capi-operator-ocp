# This NetworkPolicy allows egress traffic required for cluster-api controllers.
# Controllers need broad internet access for cloud provider APIs, container registries,
# and other external services required for cluster management operations.
#
# This policy allows all egress traffic from CAPI controller pods, which is necessary
# because controllers need to communicate with various external services:
# - Cloud provider APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
# - Container registries for image pulls
# - External services for cluster management
# - Webhook services for validation
#
# This approach is more practical than overly granular rules since controllers
# need broad access to function properly in various environments.
