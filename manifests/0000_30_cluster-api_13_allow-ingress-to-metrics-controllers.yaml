# This NetworkPolicy allows ingress traffic to CAPI controller pods on the metrics port (8443).
# This enables monitoring and observability of CAPI controllers by allowing:
# - Prometheus scraping of controller metrics
# - Health check endpoints for controller status
# - Monitoring tools to collect performance data
# - Observability platforms to track controller behavior
#
# The policy applies to all CAPI controller pods (control-plane label) and allows
# traffic from any namespace or pod to access the metrics endpoint.
# This is essential for maintaining operational visibility of the cluster-api system.
#
# This policy works with the deny-all policy to ensure metrics are accessible
# while maintaining the default-deny security model for other traffic.
