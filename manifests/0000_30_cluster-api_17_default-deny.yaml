# This policy implements a default-deny security model for the cluster-api namespace.
# It denies all ingress and egress traffic to pods in the namespace by default,
# except for CAPI controller pods and the cluster-capi-operator which need network access.
# 
# This policy works in conjunction with other network policies:
# - allow-egress-controllers: Allows egress traffic for CAPI controller pods
# - allow-egress-operators: Allows egress traffic for cluster-capi-operator
# - allow-ingress-to-metrics-controllers: Allows metrics ingress for controllers
# - allow-ingress-to-metrics-operators: Allows metrics ingress for operators
#
# The security model ensures that:
# 1. All pods are denied network access by default (this policy)
# 2. Only explicitly allowed traffic is permitted (other policies)
# 3. CAPI controllers can function normally for cluster management
# 4. The cluster-capi-operator can perform its operations
# 5. Monitoring and observability are maintained through metrics policies
